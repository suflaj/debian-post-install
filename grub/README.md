# GRUB

I use the [Sleek Theme: Dark](https://github.com/sandesh236/sleek--themes) by [sandesh236](https://github.com/sandesh236).

## Usage

Unpack the `grub/themes/sleek-theme-dark.tar.xz` file:

```bash
tar -zxf grub/themes/sleek-theme-dark.tar.xz
```

Run the unpacked `install.sh` file as `root`:

```bash
sudo bash grub/themes/install.sh
```

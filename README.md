This repository contains files I personally use as post-install scripts.

Things to keep in mind:

- at the time of writing, I'm using the following [Debian
  11.6 with non-free firmware](https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/cd-including-firmware/11.6.0+nonfree/amd64/iso-dvd/) installation
- I use [this method of installation](https://dev.to/brandonwallace/how-to-install-debian-11-bullseye-expert-mode-minimal-install-10pd)
- as of 27th Jan 2023, this is **not yet tested**

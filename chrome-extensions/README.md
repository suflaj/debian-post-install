# Chrome extensions (applies to Edge as well)

This contains the list of Chrome extensions I use. Generally, the list is fairly small,
but I still separate it into two parts:

- `essential`
- `additional`

I cannot imagine using either browser without the `essential` ones, and I would really
rather not use either browser without the `additional` ones. You're obviously free to
install whichever you want.

The extensions are presented as CSV files that contain the store ID, the name of the
extension, as well as the URL. Maybe sometimes in the future I will create an automated
script to install them if I feel like it.

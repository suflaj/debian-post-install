# Desktop Environment

Although it could theoretically be possible to automate this, I think it is easier and
more customizable if I describe the DE customization process.

## Themes

I use some fairly popular themes. Here is a list:

- Global theme: [Otto](https://store.kde.org/p/1360125)
- Color scheme: [Otto](https://store.kde.org/p/1358259/)
- Konsole color scheme: [Otto](https://store.kde.org/p/1358261/)
- Icons theme: [Papirus Pale Orange](https://store.kde.org/p/1166289)
- Splash screen: [Quarks Splash Darker](https://store.kde.org/p/1401423)
- Login theme: [Chili](https://store.kde.org/p/1214121)
- Login/lock screen wallpaper: [aenami-skylight.jpg](https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/002/054/077/medium/alena-aenami-skylight1920.jpg?1456599455)

Whether you install them, how, and from where is up to you :)
